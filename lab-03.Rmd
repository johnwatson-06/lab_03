# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```
maths & data problem - can't have 1000 billion chinese speakers. 





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

data & people - segments all different lengths. Also title doesnt make sense - how have they calculated pop density and total area




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

data & people - no scales on axes and hard to read graph




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

people - y axis label is not a label for an axis, also title doesnt make sense, also hard to read and interpret





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
wide data has the variables in column 1 whereas long data has the variables in row 1.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
wide

How many observations are there in the data set?
55



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -faculty_type, 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}


ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()


```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}


staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```
